## Features

- **Windows Classic Desktop Experience**: Pixel-perfect remake attempt of Windows 98 desktop shell components and animations.

- **Desktop Themes**: Featuring all of the original Windows 98 desktop themes, complete with color schemes, wallpapers, icon sets, and sound sets (screensavers are WIP).

- **Theme Customization**: Upload your own .theme files and wallpapers to apply to the desktop. Change the colors, set wallpaper to stretch, tile, or center. All are saved privately to your cache. (WIP).

- **Programs and Games**: Ports of popular software used in Windows 98 are included here. Most of them are existing ports and remakes made by other people, but some of them are made by myself. See Featured Applications for more info.

- **Progressive Web App**: Install it on your machine as a desktop application.

- **Free**: Use it, download the source, fork it, add your own themes and apps and games, make it your own. I don't really care. Credit and attribution are nice though.

## Featured Applications

- **Assistant**: Clippy the Office Assistant has been resurrected, now powered with AI. Ask any question about azOS. Can even give you a short tour of the OS. For more details, see the [Clippy App README](./src/apps/clippy/README.md).
- **Notepad**: Your basic text editor, now with added syntax highlighting, code formatting, and Markdown preview. For more details, see the [Notepad App README](./src/apps/notepad/README.md).
- **Winamp**: Play your favorite songs and playlists here. Customize with your own skins. A faithful recreation of the classic Winamp music player that runs directly on the desktop. For more details, see the [Webamp App README](./src/apps/webamp/README.md).
- **Internet Explorer**: Surf the Internet like it was 1998. With Retro Mode enabled, you will be brought to 1998 archived version of your favorite websites.
- **Pinball**: A web port of Space Cadet Pinball.

For a full list of applications and instructions on how to create your own, refer to the [Application Development Guide](./src/apps/README.md).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Development Server**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and modern development experience.
- **UI Libraries**:
  - [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/): A CSS library for recreating the Windows 98 GUI.
  - [os-gui](https://os-gui.js.org/): A library for building retro desktop GUI components.
    Note that both libraries have been heavily modified to combine their features and fit the needs of this project.
