# azOS, Second Edition

azOS, Second Edition is a web-based operating system interface designed to emulate a classic desktop environment. This project was born out of a sense of nostalgia and a desire to explore integrating modern LLM technology into a retro-style UI.

## Project Goal

The main purpose of this project is to create a space for experimenting with AI and other web technologies, all wrapped in a user interface that harks back to the early days of personal computing. It serves as a reminder of what sparked the passion for software engineering in the first place.

## Technologies Used

*   **Vite**: For fast and efficient frontend development.
*   **os-gui**: A library for creating the retro desktop GUI components.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## How to Add Applications

Instructions for adding new applications to the desktop environment have been moved. Please refer to the [Application Development Guide](./src/apps/README.md) for details.
