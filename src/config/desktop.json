This project was born out of a sense of nostalgia and a desire to explore integrating modern LLM technology into a retro-style UI.\n\n## Project Goal\n\nThe main purpose of this project is to create a space for experimenting with AI and other web technologies, all wrapped in a user interface that harks back to the early days of my computer experience. It serves as a reminder of what sparked my passion for software engineering in the first place.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n*   **Vite**: For fast and efficient frontend development.\n*   **98.css**: A CSS library for faithfully recreating Windows 98 GUI components.\n*   **os-gui**: A CSS/JS library for creating the retro desktop GUI components.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo run this project locally, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run the Development Server:**\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).\n\n## How to Add Applications\n\nInstructions for adding new applications to the desktop environment have been moved. Please refer to the [Application Development Guide](./src/apps/README.md) for details."
