# Desktop Themes

## Purpose

The Desktop Themes application provides a centralized interface for managing the visual appearance of the azOS desktop. Users can select from a list of pre-installed themes, preview their appearance, and apply them. It also supports loading, saving, and deleting custom themes from external `.theme` files.

## Key Features

- **Theme Selection:** A dropdown menu lists all available themes, including default, pre-installed, and custom-saved themes.
- **Live Preview:** A preview pane shows how the selected theme will affect the appearance of windows, icons, and the desktop wallpaper before it is applied.
- **Apply Themes:** Users can apply the selected theme to the entire system with "OK" or "Apply" buttons.
- **Custom Theme Loading:** Users can load custom themes from classic Windows `.theme` files. A wizard guides them through customizing colors and wallpaper.
- **Save Custom Themes:** A loaded or modified theme can be saved under a custom name, making it available for future use.
- **Delete Custom Themes:** User-saved themes can be deleted from the system.
- **Isolated Previews:** Theme previews are rendered with isolated styles to ensure the preview accurately reflects the theme's appearance without affecting the main application window.
