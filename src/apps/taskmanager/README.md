# Task Manager (Close Program)

## Purpose

The Task Manager is a system utility that provides a list of all currently running applications. Its primary function is to allow the user to forcefully close a program that may be unresponsive or needs to be terminated.

## Key Features

- **View Running Applications:** Displays a clear, simple list of all active application windows.
- **Terminate Applications:** Users can select any application from the list and use the "End Task" button to immediately close it.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The task list automatically refreshes whenever a new application is launched or an existing one is closed.
- **Simple Interface:** A straightforward, non-resizable window focused on the core task of managing open programs.

*Note: The "Switch To" and "New Task..." buttons are currently placeholders and do not have functionality.*

## How to Use

1.  Launch the **Task Manager**.
2.  The window will display a list of all programs that are currently running (excluding the Task Manager itself).
3.  Click on a program in the list to select it.
4.  Once a program is selected, the **End Task** button will become active.
5.  Click the **End Task** button to close the selected program.
