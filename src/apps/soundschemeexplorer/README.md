# Sound Scheme Explorer

## Purpose

The Sound Scheme Explorer is a utility that allows users to browse, preview, and listen to the various sound schemes available in the azOS environment. It provides an interface to explore the different audio cues associated with system events for each theme.

## Key Features

- **Scheme Selection:** A dropdown menu lists all available sound schemes (e.g., "Default," "Utopia," "Jungle").
- **Automatic Scheme Detection:** The application automatically selects the sound scheme associated with the currently active desktop theme upon launch.
- **Event Sound List:** For a selected scheme, the application displays a list of all defined system events (e.g., "SystemStart," "SystemShutdown," "CriticalStop").
- **Sound Preview:** Each sound event in the list has a "Play" button next to it, allowing the user to hear the specific sound effect.

## How to Use

1.  Launch the **Sound Scheme Explorer**.
2.  The application will default to the sound scheme of your current desktop theme.
3.  To explore other schemes, select one from the **Sound Scheme** dropdown menu at the top.
4.  The list will update to show all the sounds associated with the selected scheme.
5.  Click the triangular "Play" icon next to any event name to hear the corresponding sound.
