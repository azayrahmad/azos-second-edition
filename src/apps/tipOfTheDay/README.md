# Tip of the Day App

## Summary

The "Tip of the Day" app is a helpful utility that displays useful hints and tricks to the user upon startup. Its purpose is to improve user experience by providing quick insights into the features and functionalities of azOS Second Edition.

## Features

- **Randomized Tips**: Displays a random tip each time it is launched, ensuring users see a variety of information.
- **Tip Navigation**: A "Next Tip" button allows users to cycle through the entire list of available tips.
- **Interactive Links**: Tips can contain embedded links that, when clicked, can launch other applications. For example, a tip might include a link to open the "Clippy" assistant.
- **Startup Preference**: Includes a "Show tips at startup" checkbox, allowing users to control whether the dialog appears automatically when the system starts.

## Technical Details

- **Modular Structure**: The application is built with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, keeping its structure, styling, and logic well-organized.
- **Dynamic Content**: The HTML structure is loaded from a file, and the JavaScript injects the tip content and sets up event listeners for the buttons and interactive links.
- **Tip Management**: The list of tips is stored in an array within the `tipOfTheDay.js` file, making it easy to add, remove, or edit tips.
- **App Integration**: The `handleAppAction` utility is used to launch other applications from within a tip, demonstrating inter-app communication.
