    -   Control how the wallpaper is displayed with "Stretch," "Center," or "Tile" modes.
    -   A live preview monitor shows how the selected wallpaper will look.
- **Screen Saver Management:**
    -   Choose a screen saver from a list of available options.
    -   Set the idle time (in minutes) before the screen saver activates.
    -   Preview the selected screen saver in a mini-display or full screen.
